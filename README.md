## 🛍️ Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis

# 🎯 Objective

This project analyzes transactional retail data to:
-Identify profit-draining categories and sub-categories
-Optimize inventory turnover
-Uncover seasonal product behavior
-Deliver actionable insights for improving profitability

# 🧰 Tools Used
-SQL → Data cleaning & profitability calculations
-Python (Pandas, Seaborn) → Correlation analysis
-Power BI → Interactive dashboard & visualization storytelling

# 📊 Dashboard Highlights

# ✅ Sales Overview
-Total Sales: ₹2.30M
-Total Profit: ₹286.4K
-Average Profit Margin: 12%
-Top-Selling Category: Technology (36.4% of sales)
-Highest Region Sales: West Region (₹725K)

# ✅ Profitability Analysis

# Profit-Draining Sub-Categories:

-Tables → Loss -₹17.7K (Profit Margin -47%)
-Bookcases → Loss -₹3.47K (Profit Margin -29%)
-Appliances → Loss -₹18.1K (Profit Margin -73%)

-Phones → Profit ₹44.5K (Profit Margin +106%)

# ✅ Inventory Turnover Insights

-Average Delivery Time: 3.96 days
-Strong negative correlation between delivery time and profit → longer delivery time reduces profitability
-Slow-moving items include Tables, Bookcases, Appliances

# ✅ Seasonal Product Behavior

-Highest Sales Season: Fall (₹800K)
-Top Profitable Season: Summer → driven by Phones & Accessories
-Lowest Profit Season: Winter → driven by Furniture & Office Supplies losses

# 📝 Key Insights & Recommendations

✅ Discontinue/discount underperforming products: Tables, Bookcases, Appliances (all negative profit margins)
✅ Focus on high-profit sub-categories: Accessories, Paper, Phones → prioritize inventory & marketing
✅ Optimize delivery operations: faster shipping improves profitability
✅ Align stock levels with seasonal demand: ramp up stock for Fall, reduce Furniture stock for Winter

# 📂 Repository Structure

-Retail_Profit_Dashboard.pbit	      #Power BI dashboard template file
SQL_Queries.sql	                    #SQL scripts for cleaning & aggregation

# ✨ Why This Project Stands Out
✔️ Combines SQL, Python & Power BI in an integrated workflow
✔️ Focuses on business impact, not just reporting
✔️ Includes diagnostic & prescriptive insights
✔️ Tells a clear story → making data actionable for retail decisions

This project demonstrates my ability to turn raw data into actionable insights that drive profitability improvements in retail operations. I built this solution to empower decision-makers to:
✅ Focus on profitable products
✅ Eliminate loss-making items
✅ Optimize seasonal inventory
