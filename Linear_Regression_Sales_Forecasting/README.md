# 🔮📊 Retail Sales Forecasting with Linear Regression

## 📌 Subproject Overview

As part of my broader Retail Performance & Profitability Analysis, I built a predictive sales forecasting model using the Superstore dataset. This subproject focuses on applying **Linear Regression** to forecast upcoming sales trends and uncover valuable insights from time-series data.

> 📈 “Good data tells a story. Great data predicts the future.”

## 📊 Key Visualizations

1. **Daily Sales Trend** – Understand how sales behave over time  
2. **Predicted vs Actual Sales** – Measure how well the model fits  
3. **30-Day Sales Forecast** – Project upcoming business performance  
4. **Category-wise Trends** – Breakdown of sales by product category
